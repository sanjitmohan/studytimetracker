# Study Time Tracker

Study Time Tracker is a simple program that helps you estimate how many hours you are on track to study this week based on how much you studied today. It then compares your estimated weekly hours to your weekly study goal and tells you whether you are ahead of or behind that goal. This project includes both a Python console version and a small web version built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Project Files

- `app.py`  
  Python console version of the Study Time Tracker.

- `index.html`  
  Web version of the Study Time Tracker (runs locally in your browser).

- `style.css`  
  Stylesheet for the web version.

> Make sure `index.html` and `style.css` are in the same folder so the styling loads correctly.

## How to Run the Python Version

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt in the folder that contains `app.py`.
3. Run the program with one of the following commands:

```bash
python app.py
# or, on some systems:
python3 app.py
