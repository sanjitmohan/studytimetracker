# Study Time Tracker
Study Time Tracker is a simple Python program that helps you estimate how many hours you are on track to study this week based on how much you studied today. It also compares your estimated weekly hours to your personal study goal and tells you whether you are ahead of or behind that goal. This project is part of a Python and GitHub workflow assignment and shows basic input handling, calculations, and error handling.
